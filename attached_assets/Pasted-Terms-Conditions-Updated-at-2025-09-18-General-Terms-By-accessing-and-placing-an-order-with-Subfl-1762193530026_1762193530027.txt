General Terms
By accessing and placing an order with Subflix, you confirm that you are in agreement with and bound by the terms of service contained in the Terms & Conditions outlined below. These terms apply to the entire website and any email or other type of communication between you and Subflix.

Under no circumstances shall Subflix team be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, loss of data or profit, arising out of the use, or the inability to use, the materials on this site, even if Subflix team or an authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages. If your use of materials from this site results in the need for servicing, repair, or correction of equipment or data, you assume any costs thereof. Subflix will not be responsible for any outcome that may occur during the course of usage of our resources. We reserve the right to change prices and revise the resources usage policy at any moment without any prior intimation / notice.

Things to Note:
Shared Subscription Platform: As Subflix is a shared subscription platform, all subscriptions listed on our website are shared plans. This means the plan is shared with the required number of users to bring the cost down, unless it is explicitly mentioned as "private" or "on your number/mail" in the plan name. If any user wants a private plan, they can opt for that.

No Cancellation or Refund Policy: Once a plan has been purchased, it cannot be cancelled or refunded. Instead, you will receive a Subflix discount code equal to the value of your order, which can be redeemed on your next purchase. Please consider this carefully before completing your purchase.

Shared Plan User Sharing Examples:
Netflix (8 users)

Prime video (5 users)

Zee5 (4 users)

Crunchy roll (5 users)

Aha (5 users)

Jio Hotstar (6 users)

Sony Liv (3 users)

Netflix private (5 users) etc.

Note on Device Limits: In a shared plan, users may occasionally face device limit issues as other users are playing at the same time. Users can either wait till the other user finishes watching, or they can download and watch, or they may upgrade to the private plan. This sharing model is implemented to bring the price down.
